# ICS4U - CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization

For my data visualization CPT, I decided to compare a country’s GDP to its COVID-19 death toll per million people. In particular, I took the country’s GDP in 2017 and contrasted it to the deaths up until January 13, 2021. Unfortunately, my GDP data was a few years behind; however, by using the 2017 data, I would be able to get more data points, as there was information available for most of the countries. Similarly, at the time of research, the most recent death toll was dated January 13, 2021. The CSV file I found included the country’s name, code, continent, date of the death toll, death toll, year of the GDP, and the GDP amount. Since the file included GDP data for older years and also death tolls for 2020, I had to write a program to filter out the unnecessary information.

I chose this topic for my project because the COVID-19 pandemic is currently a global issue that affects the daily lives of many. I am interested in techniques to resolve the pandemic quicker and more efficiently. Taking this into consideration, I wanted to see if there was a correlation between a country’s economic stability and the death toll. Using this information, it is possible to identify where the most resources should be put towards. Scanning the GDP and deaths graph, it can be seen that there is a cluster of points showing that the lower the GDP, the lower the deaths. However, this can be caused by a lack of access to accurate statistics in less developed countries. Looking deeper at the graph, it can be seen that as the GDP rises, the deaths per million decrease. This trend makes sense, as more economically developed countries will have the financial stability and access to better resources to deal with the pandemic. Thus, more aid and resources should be focused on poor or economically unstable countries.
